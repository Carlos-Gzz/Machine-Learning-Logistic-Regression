You need to install the packages/modules:
Numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and pandas.
Important note: In order to properly visualize the results in a graph it is important to import matplotlib.pyplot (not only matplotlib).

Anaconda install code run:

Pandas:
conda install -c anaconda pandas 

Numpy:
conda install -c anaconda numpy

Matplotlib:
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib



In this example I go deeper into the different Regression Models and built a Logistic Regression Model for classification. Results are shown in numbers and in a visual-representation colored graph.
R is awesome, but back in the days when I wanted to expand my knowledge from R to Python I took an amazing self taught Machine Learning course called 'ML A-Z'; the course tutors are Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. And as of today I keep doing different projects with the previous knowledge learned.
